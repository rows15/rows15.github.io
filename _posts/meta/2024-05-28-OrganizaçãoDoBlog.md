  <summary>Letra:</summary>

  <pre> 
In this world of lines i find joy and confort
Even though i spend way too much time, its where i belong

I'll always have my code it's my guiding light,
Through the darkest hours, it shines so bright.

Working from nightfall, all the way to morning
i don't know how much time i spent, i'll leave when its workin'

[Refrão]

Zeores on the ones
And one on the zeroes
My variables are starting to have names of animals
x2

[final filal msm 02]
 
dictionaries lists floats and integers 
My head is full of them
As i hear birds chirping on the window
i guess its TIme toooo sleep
</pre>
